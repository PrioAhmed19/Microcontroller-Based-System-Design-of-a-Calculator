# Microcontroller-Based-System-Design-of-a-Calculator

A calculator serves as a fundamental tool in the world of electronics and computation, providing
a means to perform mathematical operations easily and accurately. Operating on the principle of
converting electrical energy into computational results, a calculator takes input through various
keys, processes the data, and displays the outcome. The versatility of a calculator lies in its
ability to handle arithmetic functions and more complex mathematical operations. The
implementation of a calculator can be approached through a combination of hardware and
software components. In the hardware realm, a microcontroller (AT89C51) is employed
alongside additional components to create the necessary input and output interfaces. Meanwhile,
the software aspect involves writing code, potentially in assembly language, to control the
microcontroller and execute the desired calculations. This dual approach aims to seamlessly
integrate the electronic components, allowing the calculator to perform a range of mathematical
tasks efficiently
